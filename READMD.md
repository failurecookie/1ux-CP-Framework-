# Update Log
## Pre-Alpha

#### 0.0.2 (Class Parser Framework + Function Framework)
- rewrote a function class for the function framework (original 1ux) and added varables for the class parser framework. no methods to append for now, but the console version of 1ux (CP framework) is released on github.

#### 0.0.1 (Class Parser Framework)
- rewrote the framework to run commands to follow a Class Parser (CP) framework. 1ux was previously written in a function based framework which minimalized producitivity and usage. With CP framework, we have much more room to expand.
- You can now use similar commands to 1ux(Func Framework) Syntax has smaller changes. To use a write command, type: "log"
